**Abstract**

Reviews have quickly become an important decision making tool for consumers considering both online and offline spending. Thus, for a new industry around buying and selling Fake Reviews has risen to meet the demand of unscrupulous businesses. The goal of this project is to generate a model that successfully classifies Fake and Genuine reviews.

**Abstract**

It has become increasingly difficult to shop as a rational consumer and buy products from retailers offering the lowest prices. There are differences in prices in the market; retailers offer the same product for different prices and external factors create price fluctuations over time. In our project we tracked prices across three major e-commerce companies: Amazon, Target and Walmart. We enable users to track baskets of items over time by providing specific URLs of items from Amazon or search for products using a keyword. Users can explore price data and check how prices change over time or which retailer sells a given item for the cheapest price at a given time by exploring graph of the prices.

**Abstract**

Recommender systems are a driving force for a variety of businesses such as retailers and entertainment services, and their popularity is only rising. On the business side, it allows the companies to offer a wide range of products, without limiting them to a confined physical space. As for the users, it makes it easier for them to make a decision when consuming a product by giving them a personal recommendation based on the choices made by users with similar interests. This project explores a basic recommendation system implementation, with a comparison to single machine implementations extension. The data set that is used for this project was provided by Goodreads - an online platform for readers to share their opinions on books they’ve read. As we have explicit feedback from the users in the form of a rating, we have used a Collaborative Filtering approach, which creates a recommendation based on the behavior history of the user as well as of users that have similar interests. Additionally, as the data matrix for this type of problem is usually very sparse, we have used an Alternating Least Squares method to process the data set and make predictions.

### [Food Happens in Vegas: How Can Restaurants Improve Their Yelp Profiles for Success?](https://github.com/anu-ujin-g/Vegas_Foodies/blob/master/DSGA1001_TermProject2019_FinalWriteUp_VegasFoodies.pdf)

**Abstract**

The purpose of this data mining project is to examine how restaurants can improve their Yelp profile to become more “successful” on Yelp in Las Vegas, Nevada. Differently from the traditional approaches to this dataset, our methodology defines “success” as a binary variable through an exploratory analysis of the restaurants’ review counts and ratings on Yelp. Feature variables include categories and attributes that Yelp users can use to select which restaurant to visit. For this project, we ran Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to explore key features associated with “success” and obtain recommendations for restaurants to improve their Yelp profile. Final results indicate that determinants of success vary by cuisine type.

### [Amazon.com and Its Effect on the Retail Market and Employment](/pdf/Gerelt-Od_Thesis.pdf)

**Abstract**

Amazon.com is one of the fastest growing companies in the US and its expansion threatens the continuance of brick and mortar stores. As we see an increase in the number of department store shutdowns, e-commerce is seen to be at the center for blame. However, that may not be true as Amazon is becoming a large contributor in the job market by providing more positions with better wages. Additionally, other sectors including warehousing and courier services are complement industries and they might see a positive growth in employment as a result of the expansion of the e-commerce giant.
